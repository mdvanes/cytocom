> Visually explore genealogical data

Make a graph visualisation with [Cytoscape.JS](https://js.cytoscape.org/) and [read-gedcom](https://docs.arbre.app/read-gedcom/) for [GEDCOM](https://www.gedcom.org/) genealogical data collections.

## Notes

- To be able to tell if parents in a family are married, the event "married" should be set, even without a date. Setting the relationship type "married" in GRAMPS is not enough.
- To show an URL, add a field under "Internet" in GRAMPS of type "Web Home"
- color scheme: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
